### **Bonded Ring** (Sp)

If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded ring worn or in hand, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell's level. If the ring is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.

A bonded ring can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard's level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.

{{ c.info.levels.hd >= 7 ? "At 7th level a wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded ring as if he had [Forge Ring]. The magic properties of a bonded ring, including any magic abilities added to the ring, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded ring's owner dies, or the ring is replaced, the ring reverts to being an ordinary item." : "" }}

If a bonded ring is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the ring is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs {{200 * c.info.levels.wizard}} gp. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded ring. A wizard can designate an existing magic ring as his bonded ring. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed ring except that the new ring retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded ring.
